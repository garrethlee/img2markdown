# Notes

I used [bolt.new](https://bolt.new) to build this simple app in under 20 minutes. 

At the time, my workflow was using v0 + Cursor to bootstrap prototypes, but the experience wasn't as seamless, especially when it came to installing libraries & dependencies, which adds so much friction to the experience. When I heard of bolt.new, I wanted to try it (hence this project) and the results were quite nice.

(Semi) Interesting Stuff:
- In `.bolt`, you can see the system prompt used to generate the initial scaffolding. Unlike v0 (which prefers shadcn), bolt uses `lucide-react` for components / icons.
- The actual app development took 10 minutes, the other 10 minutes was spend waiting for the app to deploy on Netlify & linking the code to GitHub.
